Just your typical Christian, husband, father, teacher, minister, gamer, guitar player, linux enthusiast, computer builder, tech juknie.

I love my family. I like virtually all things technology. I enjoy meeting with my Church. I enjoy all of the students that I teach. I like to play video games and I like learning new things. For example, I am learning about github and jekyll while putting up this website. Too cool. Hobbies are fun.

This site can exist because of my wonderful jobs, both teaching and with the Church. It can also only exist because of my wife and her tollerance of my love of goofy, nerdy things. If you like what you see; cool! I am glad. If you don't, then feel freee to Alt+F4. I won't mind.
