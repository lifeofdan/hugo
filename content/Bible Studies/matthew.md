### Introduction
Chapter 13 deals with many parables. It speaks of the parable of the Sower,  the explanation of why Jesus uses parables, the parable of the weeds, the parable of the mustard seed and the leaven, prophecy and parables, the parable of hidden treasure, the parable of the pearl of great value, the parable of the net and new and old treasures. It also tells the story of how Jesus was rejected at Nazareth.

#### Has AATorP Changed?
Jesus speaks to the crowd, and then to the Disciples. This can give any believer insight into how people come to belief in Jesus Christ and the kinds of reactions that can be expected. That makes this information general and applicable to everyone. 

#### Synopsis of Chapter
Chapter 13 is a very well known parable of the sower. It tells a story of different types of converts and how they react to learning about Christ. First, Jesus tells the crowd the story and then He explains the meaning of the story to the disciples, and then us by way of the written Word.

### Verses 1-23

Jesus tells the story of the parable of the sower. It tells of different places that seeds can land when sown. These places are 1. The Path, 2. The Rocky Ground, 3. The Thorns, 4. The Good Soil. 

#### Q1. Would you have understood the story if you did not have the answer given to you as the disciples did?

**Answer:** Answers may vary. 

Some of these parables are, indeed, difficult to understand. Praise be to God that Jesus' words are recorded here so that we may understand these truths plainly. Those of us who have grown up in the Church may think that these things are easy to understand, but to the unbeliever who is hearing these things for the first time, they can be incomprehensible. (Read [Acts 8:26-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8%3A26-40&version=ESV "Bible Gateway"))

##### The Path

The Path represents the type of people that hears the word of the kingdom, does not understand it. These ones then have what has been sown snatched away from by the "evil one", which refers to Satan.  

The Bible often refers to Christianity as a path. 

#### Q2. Can you think of any other times the Bible refers to a "path" in regards to Christianity?

**Answer:** The Bible talks about Jesus being The Way, the Bible talks about there being two paths, one wide and one narrow. The Bible talks about there being only one "way", or "path", to God. 

#### Q3. Why do you think the "path" is a good description?

**Answer:** A path goes somewhere. The destination we are journeying towards is either eternal bliss or eternal punishment. We are all traveling somewhere, time for us will eventually end, and we need to make sure we are going the right direction.


##### The Rocky Ground

![rocky ground](/img/stones-258765_640.jpg)

The rocky ground represents a person who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, but then falls away because they don't have deep roots to keep them grounded when things get difficult. 

#### Q4. Will things ever get difficult?

**Answer:** Yes, they will. We need to do our best to prepare people that there will be trials. However, some people will not be ready or they will not handle the trials that come in a Christian way. They will be hurt and they will fall away. We need to be in the Word in order to make sure that we are ready when persecution or trials come our way, because they **ARE** coming. 

#### Q5. Have you ever had difficulty that made it hard to accept that difficulty with the perseverance that we are called to have as Christians?

**Answer:** Answers may vary. *(On a personal note, I have grown up from a young age believing in the scriptures. I have not always had an easy time in life, but I have had a good life. I have not felt persecution or suffering beyond what God could help me handle. That being said, I have found times difficult. My Mum getting cancer, situations with work over the years, not being able to do what I thought God wanted me to do. Doing what I really knew God probably didn't want me to do. Loneliness, broken friendships, broken relationships, all of these things are hard. God is a constant. He is a stalwart friend that will never leave or forsake me, primarily because He is always there when things are hard, even when it doesn't seem like it.)*

##### The Thorns

![thorns](/img/thorns-2013825_640.jpg)

These are people who initially hear the word but the things in the world are too appealing or the troubles the come into from chasing worldly things destroys their faith and they prove to be unfruitful. 

#### Q6. How could things in the world choke out the Word of God?

**Answer:** Anything that threatens the place of God in our lives can choke out our relationship with Him. There are many things that are good, such as having enough money to feed ourselves, our houses, our family, our friends. However, any of these things could become more important to us that God, if not in our minds, in our acts. If we spend time with our family but never with God, then we have allowed our relationship with others to become more important than the relationship with our creator. Similarly, as an example, it is important to work in order to provide for our family. However, if our work takes over to a point where we never spend any time or energy on our family, then they will feel resentful of the work, even though it is providing for real needs.

##### The Good Soil

![hands holding small plant in good soil](/img/hands-1838658_640.jpg)

These are the kinds of people who hear the word and understand what it means. These people accomplish great things for the kingdom of God because they understand and are moved to action because of that understanding. 

#### Q7. Why would an understanding of the "good news" spur us to action?

**Answer:** Anything that is important requires something of us. As it says in [James 2:14-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A14-26&version=ESV), faith without works is dead.
