A second post? **_Whaaaaat!_** I cannot believe I am about to write the second post on a site that I have created. I really enjoy the process of creating the site and making it work. I generally don't care about actually using it. But, this seems kind of special to me.

I have been working more and more with *git*. I really like it. I haven't really used the more advanced functions that it offers, but I believe I am learning the basics. I like working in the terminal. I like feeling like I am doing something lego*"ish"* to my computer or to a server. It is giving me good opportunities to test things that I might put into production as well. For instance, I may be creating a "Jitsi" server for my church to use. I am not sure if this is something I want to do yet, as I'm not sure how I can get people on Android or iOS into a meeting room. There is a jitsi app as well, but I don't know anything about making an app yet. Hopefully I will be able to talk my brother into helping me with that part...

The work with my home church has been great! It has been a little different than I first imagined. There isn't enough time to do absolutely *everything* that I had wanted to do. I also don't find myself spending as much time with web-development kinds of things as I had planned to. However, I believe that is only temporary. We have a visitor and my Dad is traveling around with him **atm**, so I am doing more lesson writing. The lesson writing is **daunting**, but *enjoyable*.

Finding the work balance with my other job has been a challenge. There is so much I would like to do, but I have found it easier to say no and to balance that job with my life since cutting back on it. I now know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I can't accomplish everything, and so I know that I don't have to try to. I keep to the things that **must** be done, and try not to get sucked into the things that *could* be done. I have worked long hours -- some 12 hr days -- but because that only happens twice a week instead of 6 days a week, it isn't as hard to handle. 

Anyway, I am rambling, so I will stop. For me, life is good. Even after the newness has worn off.
