This is my first post using [**Hugo**](gohugo.io). I heard about it while watching "Linux Thursday" which is one of the shows on [The Lunduke Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgKlqRA4hw). They said it was faster and simpler than Jekyll, which is what I have been using. I had just spend most of the day yesterday setting up my Jekyll site and while I like Jekyll I am wondering if there is something a bit more streamlined. I don't really want to be installing gems. I mean, for Pete's sake, I'm writing in markdown. You know I want it to be easy. 

*Anyway*. This is my first post. We will see how it goes!
