# Wholly Follow the Lord
![Man Praying](/img/leaf-2562765_1920.jpg)

When we think about what it means to be a Christian, what do we think about? Do we think about praying before meals? Do we think about reading our Bible? Do we think about not saying certain words, or eating certain foods, or drinking certain drinks, or all the things that we aren't supposed to do? Do we think about all of the things we *are* supposed to do?

In many ways, we as people like to segregate our time, our money, our relationships into neat little boxes. These are my, basketball friends, these are my co-workers, this is my family. However, there is one part of life that we have to be careful not to separate from the rest of our lives, and that is how we follow God. We are to be **wholly** His. But what does it mean to **wholly** follow God? That is what we will be looking at today. So if you want to open your Bibles up, we will be looking at Joshua 14:6-14, but before we do that, I would just like to pray for our study. 

>**_Joshua 14:6–15_**

>*Caleb's Request and Inheritance*

>[6] Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me. [7] I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. [8] But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I wholly followed the LORD my God. [9] And Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.’ [10] And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, just as he said, these forty-five years since the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old. [11] I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war and for going and coming. [12] So now give me this hill country of which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day how the Anakim were there, with great fortified cities. It may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out just as the LORD said.”

>[13] Then Joshua blessed him, and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. [14] Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel. [15] Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba. (Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.) And the land had rest from war. (ESV)

## Wholly Follow the Lord, Even When Others Do Not
![Man, alone](/img/portrait-3052641_1920.jpg)
The first thing that I think that we can see and learn from these verses is that we need to _wholly follow the Lord, even when others do not_. In verse 8 of chapter 14 we are reminded of the story of the 12 men who went to spy on Canaan. I don't know how many of you know that song "12 men went to spy on Canaan, 10 were bad and 2 were good". That one is a favorite for my boys. But, if you remember the story, 12 men are sent in to spy, and 10 of them said, "No, there are huge people in that land, they are too scary, we can't do it, we can't take the land." But there were two that objected to this claim. Those two men were Joshua and Caleb. Joshua is now the leader of the Israelites, but Caleb is speaking for the clan of Judah here and Caleb reminds Joshua that he was there and he also wholly followed the "Lord his(my) God" in this instance, even though all others around him "melted". I like that word "melted" it really makes you think of how weak they were, they just melted away. However, it was because Caleb "wholly followed the Lord" that this land was actually promised to him by Moses. 

Have you ever been alone in following God? It isn't easy.

## Wholly Follow the Lord, He Will Give You Strength
When we wholly follow the Lord, sometimes we will have to do it alone. However, He will with us and give us strength. 

>**_Joshua 14:10-11_**

>[10] And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, just as he said, these forty-five years since the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old. [11] I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war and for going and coming.

Forty-five years. That is a long time to wait to realise a promise. Sometimes I tell Cody that I will do something later in the same day and he will find it hard to wait that long. Here we see that Caleb waits 45 years to realise the promise of God. We see many people in the Bible who wait a long time to realise the promises of God. We see the example of Abraham and how long he waited for the promised birth of Isaac. We see Israel waiting on the Messiah for hundreds of years. We personally probably know people who have waited their entire lives to see the Lord's second coming and who have died waiting. I don't think any of us have that much patience built into us. That in itself, must be divine. However, I think that it is amazing to see that after 45 years that Caleb can say:

>"I am this day eighty-five years old. [11] I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then," **Joshua 14:10b-11a**
