This lesson continues the sermon series on the Woes to the Scribes and Pharisees. I had originally thought that this would take maybe two Sundays to go over, but I have really enjoyed diving a little deeper into these verses than I might normally, so I hope that you have found it useful as well. 

Before we begin though, let's pray. 

**Matthew 23:23-28 _ESV_**

> 23 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. 24 You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!

> 25 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. 26 You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean.

> 27 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. 28 So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. 

## The Weightier Matters
![Camel relaxing](/img/camel-1348472_1920.jpg)

<!-- Why did they tithe mint, dill, and cumin specifically? I am sure this is a Levitical law. Are the Pharisees Levites? Or was this a general command to all the Israelites? -->
**Christianity can seem hard at times.** We are even told in Luke 9:23 to "deny ourselves and take up our crosses daily". Denying ourselves and taking up our crosses are not easy things to do. We don't live in a society where either of these things are viewed as important. We live in a society that says "If it feels good, do it." Christianity is not easy. We looked this last Sunday in some of our home groups at the fact that Christianity is a process of continual observance of faithfulness and that if we don't continue to be faithful, then we can fall away. While I don't want to delve into that topic specifically today, I think all of us probably think about our faith regularly and question ourselves with "Am I living faithfully?" And I think that is healthy. But sometimes, in our desire to live faithfully and wanting to know that we are "Okay with God", we can boil things down to a formula. 

* Did I pray today? &#10004;
* Did I read my Bible for exactly five minutes. &#10004; 
* Did I post a Bible verse on my Facebook so that I can say that I "shared the Gospel" this week. &#10004;

**It seems to be in our nature, and in the nature of the Scribes and Pharisees to boil things down to the easiest thing possible.** Is tithing important? *Of course*. However, it is important because it is an aspect of faithfulness. I am going to give an example that is going to make everyone in their seat get a little uncomfortable, but stick with me. Sometimes I think we can use baptism, repentance, and confession in these same ways. The process of becoming a Christian is not a checklist of did I turn away from sin, and did I get dunked, those are two things that we do because we want to live in faithfulness to God, not because if we do them that the act, in-of-itself is going to save us, but because it is a demonstration of our faith, belief and obedience to what God calls us to do. If we neglect those **_"Weightier matters"_**, then splashing around in some water isn't going to do us any good. And I think that if we simply bring people to that point of accepting that they are a sinner, repenting, confessing and being baptised, without connecting, and demonstrating through our words and actions that those are just **one part** of *faithful living*, we are simply making people "more a child of hell", **just like** the Pharisees did. 


## Filth on the Inside, Clean on the Outside
![Sign saying "Just because it looks clean on the outside doesn't mean it's clean on the inside."](https://usresponserestoration.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/anacostia-river-fish-study-clean-outside-not-inside-sign.jpg)

### The Cup
In a D.C. Community near Anacostia River, people are eating and sharing fish from a contaminated river. 

> One of the most notable chemical pollutants in the river is polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which have immune, reproductive, endocrine, and neurological effects, and may cause cancer and affect children’s cognitive development. This and other chemicals build up in the river bottom, where they make their way up the food chain and become stored in the tissues of fish, posing a health threat if people consume them. [Link to original article.](https://usresponserestoration.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/study-reveals-d-c-community-near-anacostia-river-are-eating-and-sharing-contaminated-fish/)

Now the problem in this case is multi-fold. People see the fish, they look good to eat, and so they eat them. However, there are signs up that say that just because it looks clean, doesn't mean it is. These signs warn people of the dangers, and yet people do it anyway. Now the reason in this case is this river runs through a very poor area and people are more interested in having something to keep them from being hungry today than they are of the long term effects later on.

Now, how do we clean up the fish in this river and make them good to eat again? We clean up the river. The things going into the fish have to be clean. If the inside is clean, the outside will be clean as well. 

These Scribes and Pharisees are much like these fish. They look good and clean, but taking into yourself the way that they live will cause deadly long term effects. They look good on the outside but inside are full of greed and self-indulgence. Remember in the previous verse they are tithing, which is supposed to be us giving to God what is His. But they are still full of greed and self-indulgence despite trying to seem like they are giving to God freely. The act was not penetrating their hearts. If they would get rid of the greed and self-indulgence they would give freely and would then appear righteous as a by-product instead of just doing it to appear righteous.

So, how do we clean the insides of ourselves? Jesus talks a lot about himself being "the living water" to the woman at the well in John 4:14. He talks about Himself being "the bread of life" in John 6:35. In the institution of the Lord's supper we remember the body and blood of Jesus Christ while taking into ourselves the bread and the fruit of the vine. We need to take in Jesus. We do that through several means. James says that if we need wisdom, we are to ask for it. That is, we are to pray. Paul says that we are to "pray without ceasing" and I would challenge you to try that this week. It is hard. But we need to be people, who when we are happy, we thank God for it. When we are sad, we tell God about it. When we have success, the first person we should want to share that success with is God. The first person we should go to for comfort should be God. We need to make Him the centre of our lives and part of that means taking into ourselves a prayerful relationship and constant requests for wisdom from God. The other way that we take the living water and bread of life into ourselves is through the words of God. We can only get those through opening the word of God. And that is hard in our modern society. We get up, we get ready for work or school or whatever, we eat, we work or we study, we shop, we cook, we clean, we look after children, we look after spouses, we do things with or for friends, and when we get to the end of the day we have nothing left for the God of the Universe that keeps our very world spinning. Forget about saving the best for Him, we don't have anything left to give Him. We come to Him empty. Thankfully, God doesn't need anything we could give Him. Paul says in Romans 15:13 that his prayer for the people is that 

**Romans 15:13 _NIV_**

> May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

We come, thinking we are empty and don't have anything to give and so we don't open His word, but ironically it is opening His word that will give you the peace and joy that you desire. That isn't to say that His word isn't challenging. It is, but it is also hopeful. It is invigorating to read the words of God. These words have power. Sometimes we fear that this "sword" as it is referred to will cut us and so we keep it on the shelf and out of our hands, but it is there to bring us peace as well. It is there to give us hope and to cut ourselves off from it for fear of the cuts that may come is detrimental to our mental and spiritual health. 

We cleanse ourselves through prayer, the word of God and through encouragement from other Christians. 

**Philippians 2:1-2 _ESV_**

> 1 So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, 2 complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. 

We grow closer to God through our relationship of prayer and study of His Word. While we do that, we collectively offer affection, sympathy, love, joy to each other and we grow together to be of full accord and of the same mind.

Everywhere around us we see people talking of community. We see an explosion of social media. There are ways of contacting people 24 hours a day 7 days a week, 365 days a year and yet studies show repeatedly that people are more lonely now than ever. 

One **extremely** important way that we are to cleanse ourselves and keep ourselves whole is through the relationships we have with each other. I admit, this is a hard area for me. I am quite an introverted person by nature. I would much rather sit by myself with a book or on my computer than I would rather go out and be with people. But you know what? When I do get out with other Christians, there is a filling that you can't get by yourself. Just this last week, we had dinner with a couple in the Drayton Church. And as I always do when I'm going to be put in a social situation I start to get nervous. I get nervous about what we are going to talk about, I worry that the conversation won't flow. I worry that I will be awkward. But do you know what? It was as easy as falling off a bridge being with this other couple. We had Christ in common. We talked about work, we talked about raising kids in a Christian way in a non-Christian society. We talked about the worries we had for our children. We talked about the importance of family and throughout all of these things Christian values and Christian living were central, so it was easy to relate and I went away feeling rejuvenated knowing that there were people like us, going through the same things we are and are walking with the Lord with us. 

### The Tomb

The next verse talks of more of the same thing as the previous verse, but in a different contextual example. It still pronounces a woe on the scribes and Pharisees for appearing outwardly beautiful but being unclean on the inside but instead of there being an inward component of taking in filth from a dirty cup, here they are desecrating themselves from the outside-in. They are referred to as whitewashed tombs. But inside, they are full of "dead man's bones and all uncleanness. 

<!-- Look up more on this topic -->
In Jewish society dead bodies desecrated the body of a person. If someone touched a dead body they became unclean and had to go through a ritual to cleanse themselves. 

I think we can think of this in practical ways in our own lives. There are things that we can do, touch, feel, that make us unclean. One thing that we can do with our bodies that makes us unclean is sexual immorality. In 1 Corinthians there are many stories about uncleanness in the community because of sexual immorality. There was one case where one man was sleeping with his father's wife. The Corinthians are advised the remove that person from the body of believers because by his very association with the body of Christ he was making all of them unclean. We learned in our last lesson on these chapters that we are the Temple of God. Together as a group we are the Body of Christ. This unclean person is a tumor that needs to be removed, lest the whole body fall to the corruption. 

These scribes and Pharisees are unwilling to cleanse themselves, and thus they needed to be removed.
