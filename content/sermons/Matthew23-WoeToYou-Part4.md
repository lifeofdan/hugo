This lesson continues the sermon series on the Woes to the Scribes and Pharisees. I had originally thought that this would take maybe two Sundays to go over, but I have really enjoyed diving a little deeper into these verses than I might normally, so I hope that you have found it useful as well. 

Before we begin though, let's pray. 

**Matthew 23:23-28 _ESV_**

> 23 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. 24 You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!

> 25 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. 26 You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean.

> 27 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. 28 So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. 

## The Weightier Matters

**Christianity can seem hard at times.** We are even told in Luke 9:23 to "deny ourselves and take up our crosses daily". Denying ourselves and taking up our crosses are not easy things to do. We don't live in a society where either of these things are viewed as important. We live in a society that says "If it feels good, do it." Christianity is not easy. We looked this last Sunday in some of our home groups at the fact that Christianity is a process of continual observance of faithfulness and that if we don't continue to be faithful, then we can fall away. While I don't want to delve into that topic specifically today, I think all of us probably think about our faith regularly and question ourselves with "Am I living faithfully?" And I think that is healthy. But sometimes, in our desire to live faithfully and wanting to know that we are "Okay with God", we can boil things down to a formula. 

* Did I pray today? &#10004;
* Did I read my Bible for exactly five minutes. &#10004; 
* Did I post a Bible verse on my Facebook so that I can say that I "shared the Gospel" this week. &#10004;

**It seems to be in our nature, and in the nature of the Scribes and Pharisees to boil things down to the easiest thing possible.** Is tithing important? *Of course*. However, it is important because it is an aspect of faithfulness. I am going to give an example that is going to make everyone in their seat get a little uncomfortable, but stick with me. Sometimes I think we can use baptism, repentance, and confession in these same ways. The process of becoming a Christian is not a checklist of did I turn away from sin, and did I get dunked, those are two things that we do because we want to live in faithfulness to God, not because if we do them that the act, in-of-itself is going to save us, but because it is a demonstration of our faith, belief and obedience to what God calls us to do. If we neglect those **_"Weightier matters"_**, then splashing around in some water isn't going to do us any good. And I think that if we simply bring people to that point of accepting that they are a sinner, repenting, confessing and being baptised, without connecting, and demonstrating through our words and actions that those are just **one part** of *faithful living*, we are simply making people "more a child of hell", **just like** the Pharisees did.
